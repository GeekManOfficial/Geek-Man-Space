    <h3>Description: Starting to communicate with an amazing person,
    he filled me from head to toe with puzzles that he managed to do in 8 years.
    Some were given very easily, and some were introduced into a stupor and it could take more than one day to solve them.
    This puzzle is one of those, I liked it and I decided to repeat it on Construct 3.</h3>
